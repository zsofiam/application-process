# Application Process

## Story

Handling the application process at Codecool has always been a tedious task. Finally the HR department figured out that using only Python and long lists can not go on if they want to get information quickly. To improve on data management, they collaborate with you to test out something they just heard about: "databases".

Luckily they managed to assemble a database which can be described by the Entity-Relationship Diagram below:

![application process assignment.png](media/web-python/application-process-assignment.png)

They need your help to to write application which runs queries on this database so they can quickly get information about Applicants and Mentors.

The HR department wants answers to the following questions:

## What are you going to learn?

- SQL basic commands (SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT)
- executing SQL queries from python
- showing the results on a web page with jinja2 template engine
- CSS basics


## Tasks

1. We already have a list where we can see every mentor in Codecool on the `/mentors` route but we need to extend it a little.
    - Unfortunately we have a bug and the `Filter by mentor last name` feature is not working. Fix this feature so when we search for the last name "Simpson" for example we get:
  - Bart Simpson - Budapest
  - Homer Simpson - Warsaw
  - Lisa Simpson - Budapest
    - On this `/mentors` page created a separate form somewhere. There there should be a submit button in it and a `<select name="city-name">` tag with five city options: Bucharest, Budapest, Krak√≥w, Miskolc and Warsaw.
    - Submitting the form with `Miskolc` selected we should jump to `/mentors?city-name=miskolc` url and this page should by default list four mentors:
  - Bugs Bunny - Miskolc
  - Bob Sponge - Miskolc
  - Yogi Bear - Miskolc
  - Porky Pig - Miskolc

2. We had chat with an applicant, some Jemima. We don't remember her name, but she left her hat at the school. We want to call her to give back her hat. To look professional, we also need her full name when she answers the phone.
    - On the main page (`/`) you created a separate form inside the `<section class="search">` tag, there is one input with `applicant-name` name attribute and a submit button in it.
    - Submitting the form with the name `Jemima` we get a result page on the `/applicants-phone` route. This page should by default list two applicants:
  - Name: Arnold Jemima, Phone number: 003620/423-4261
  - Name: Jemima Foreman, Phone number: 003620/834-6898
    - In the `data_manager.py` there is a `get_applicant_data_by_name` function that returns a list of dictionaries with `full_name` and `phone_number` keys for the found applicants.

3. We called Jemima and she said it's not her hat. It belongs to another girl, who went to the famous Adipiscingenimmi University. You should write a query to get the same information like with Carol, but for this other girl. The only thing we know about her is her school e-mail address ending: `adipiscingenimmi.edu`
    - On the main page (`/`) you created a separate form inside the `<section class="search">` tag, there is one input with `email-ending` name attribute and a submit button in it.
    - Submitting the form with the email ending of `adipiscingenimmi.edu` we get a result page on the `/applicants-phone` route. This page should by default list one applicant:
  - Name: Jane Forbes, Phone number: 003670/653-5392
    - In the `data_manager.py` there is a `get_applicant_data_by_email_ending` function that returns a list of dictionaries with `full_name` and `phone_number` keys for the found applicants.

4. The recrouters would like to see all the applicants on one page with every data we know about them.
    - There is a link to the `/applicants` route from the main page in the `<nav>` tag.
    - On this new `/applicants` page all our applicants are listed in a well formed table.
    - In the `data_manager.py` there is a `get_applicants` function that returns a list of dictionaries with `first_name`, `last_name`, `phone_number`, `email` and `application_code` keys for all applicants.

5. Ursa William, an applicant called us, that her phone number changed to: 003670/223-7459. For this we need a new page where we can see her details and update her phone number.
    - There is a link to every applicant in the table at the `/applicants` route, the new link should look like this: `/applicants/91220`, where the number is the application code of the applicant, in this example Ursa William.
    - On this new `/applicants/<code>` page every detail is shown for the applicant who's application code is the `<code>` part of the url.
    - On this page you have created a form with `POST` method and the action should be the same page it is on. In this form there is one input with `new-phone` name attribute and a submit button.
    - When you submit the form you should save the new phone number, write an `UPDATE` query, that changes this data in the database for this applicant. At the end redirect back to the same page so when you refresh the page it does not want to re-send the POST request with the data.
    - Create a `Delete applicant` link on this page, it should point to the `/applicants/<code>/delete` url. The `<code>` part of the url should be an application code (eg: `/applicants/91220/delete`). When clicked the given applicant should be deleted and we are redirected to the `/applicants` page.

6. Arsenio, an applicant called us, that he and his friend applied to Codecool. They both want to cancel the process, because they got an investor for the site they run: `mauriseu.net` Write a DELETE query to remove all the applicants, who applied with emails for this domain (e-mail address has this domain after the @ sign).
    - On the `/applicants` page you created a form with `POST` method after the table. There is one input with `email-ending` name attribute and a submit button in it.
    - Submitting the form with the email ending of `mauriseu.net` all applicants get deleted who's email end with this domain. After that we are redirected to the `/applicants` page.

7. After this call a new applicant appeared at the school and he wants to get into the application process. His first and last name is `Markus Schaffarzyk`, has a number: `003620/725-2666` and e-mail address: `djnovusgroovecoverage.com` Our generator gave him the following application code: `54823`.
    - There is a link to the `/add-applicant` page somewhere on the `/applicants` page.
    - On the `/add-applicant` page you created a form with `POST` method with an input field for every data and a submit button in it.
    - After submitting the form and INSERTing the data redirect to this applicants page (use the unique application code for the url)

8. Your task here is to create a special design for the Flask app. Of course you don't have to create such beautiful designs with lots of images and artwork, the purpose of the task is to practice the newly acquired CSS knowledge. You can use the already created main.css file.
    - Create a design where you use at least the following CSS selectors:
  - body, h1, footer
  - id selector
  - few class selectors
  - selector which selects tags inside another tag
  - selector which changes different elements at once (for this you can use comma as a separator)
    - Please use at least these properties while altering the design:
  - font-family, color, background-color, text-align
  - padding, margin, width, height, top, left
  - display, position

Remember, the goal is to practice CSS, so we don't require you to spend tens of hours to create a wonderful design, but if you want to, you can unleash your inner creativity dragon just make sure you do that after everything else :)

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- You can find the sql file with the sample data in the data folder in the git repo. To use it, create a new database for this project and use `psql` to execute the SQL commands in that file:
    - Start `psql` in a terminal at the `data` folder of the project
    - Connect to your already created new database eg. `\connect application_process`
    - Execute the commands in the sql file `\i application_process_sample_data.sql`
- For the full_name you need a concatenation in your query, instead of having the name in 2 different columns in the result.
